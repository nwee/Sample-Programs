COMP4920 Management and Ethics Project
--------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to plan, develop and design a application over a period of time.

This program was designed based on the 'Tetris Battle' game on Facebook. 

It features traditional tetris levels and modes as well as additional features such as a local competitive multiplayer mode and a simple AI system.
