Colorwall Client Application
---------------------------

This program was created during my internship in S1T2. 

The purpose of the program was to receive signal input from the SICK TIM5xx Laser device when a ball is thrown past, and respond with a visual indicator at the detected coordinate. The visual indicator would be in the form of a temporary color explosion animation with text overlayed from user tweets or a tablet input. 

The background features multiple pictures that change over time with new pictures sent via tweets or from a database.

S1T2 has also posted a short video demonstrating it:
